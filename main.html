	<!-- <h2> Explanation of the Complexity</h2> -->

	<p align= justify> In computer science, time complexity is a crucial measure of an algorithm's performance, quantifying the amount of time it takes to run as a function of the input size. Developers often strive to design algorithms that are highly efficient, aiming for lower time complexities to ensure that software remains responsive and scalable, even with large datasets.</p>

	
	<p align= justify>When algorithms are designed, equally important to time is<b> Space Complexity</b>, which measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run. For instance, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means the memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input data 'n', which can be a significant consideration for very large datasets or memory-constrained environments.</p>
